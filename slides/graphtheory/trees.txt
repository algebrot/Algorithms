Trees are a special form of graph

They come in directed and undirected flavors

Definitions:
An acyclic connected graph
A connected graph with N-1 edges
A graph in which any two vertices are connected by exactly one path


Rooted trees


child, parent

root node

Only the root node in a rooted tree doesn't have a parent, although sometimes it
could be useful for the root node to have itself as a parent (e.g filesystem).

leaf node - nodes with no children

subtrees

Binary tree is a tree for which every node has at most two child nodes

(steal examples from binary tree slides)



>>> Solve simple tree problem


function Height(node):


    public boolean isValidBST(TreeNode root) {
        return validate(root, Long.MIN_VALUE, Long.MAX_VALUE);
    }

    public boolean validate(TreeNode node, long min, long max) {
        // Reached bottom of tree
        if (node == null) return true;
        
        // Verify invariant 
        if (min >= node.val || max <= node.val) return false;
        
        return validate(node.left, min, node.val) && validate(node.right, node.val, max);
    }


Root tree:
  select a node to be the root node
  recursively do a BFS and attach children while making sure not to
    point back to the parent
  starting from any node
